# U++ Oracle

Simple AI assistant using the GPT-3 API service from OpenAI.

Currently the Chat models are not supported (some work started, but a lot of the code is really "emulating" chat models using the davinci-003 model).

## Dependencies
- OpenIconic (https://github.com/lindquist/uppmisc)
- AiCommon (https://github.com/lindquist/aicommon)

## Building
Check out the three required Nests somewhere and make an Assembly.

Currently only tested on Windows with Clang.
